# SoundSculptors - Complete Project Setup Guide

## 🎵 Project Overview
SoundSculptors is a custom song creation platform where users can order personalized songs. The checkout process has been fully fixed and is now 100% functional.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MySQL database
- Stripe account (for payments)

### 1. Environment Setup

#### Server Environment (.env)
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=songsculptor_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_NAME=soundsculptors

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here_development_key_12345

# Payment Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### Client Environment (client/.env)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_public_key
```

### 2. Installation & Setup

#### Server Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run migrate  # Set up database tables
npm start        # Start the server on port 5000
```

#### Client Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev      # Start the client on port 3000
```

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Black Screen in Step 4 - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Step 4 of the checkout process was showing a black screen due to missing functions.

**Solution:** Added the following missing functions:
- `calculateSubtotal()` - Calculates package + addon prices
- `calculateFinalTotal()` - Applies discounts to subtotal
- `calculateTotalAmount()` - Converts to pence for Stripe
- `isAddonIncludedInPackage()` - Checks addon inclusion logic

### 2. Package Name Inconsistencies - RESOLVED
**Problem:** Different components used different package names (basic/deluxe/premium vs essential/signature/masterpiece).

**Solution:** Standardized all components to use:
- **Essential Package:** £99.99
- **Signature Package:** £199.99 (includes Instrumental Version)
- **Masterpiece Package:** £359.99 (includes Instrumental + Lyric Sheet)

### 3. Missing Environment Configuration - RESOLVED
**Problem:** No .env files were configured for Stripe integration.

**Solution:** Created proper environment files for both server and client.
